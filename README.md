# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is compare different sampling algorithms and compare two new machine learning models to reduce bias and predict credit risk.

## Results
As a result of the analysis. oversampling and undersampling did not prove to be a viable prediction model, neither did a combination of the two, as seen below.

The ensmble methods also failed to perform a proper prediction.
